- Accent color: Muted Teal (#80CBC4) for subtle highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and highly readable design.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons that are soft and rounded to maintain the ASMR-inspired aesthetic.

- Use Framer Motion for smooth and calming animations, such as fade-ins, gentle transitions, and subtle hover effects. Ensure animations do not distract from the content.
